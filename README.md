# PosturePal

**PosturePal** is a real-time posture monitoring application built with Python. It uses computer vision to track a user's posture and provides gentle, non-intrusive alerts when poor posture is detected for a sustained period.  

The goal of PosturePal is to help users maintain good posture without being disruptive, making it an ideal tool for office workers, students, or anyone who spends long hours sitting at a desk.
